=head1 release_guide.pod - guide to Rakudo releases

Rakudo's development release cycle is based on Parrot's release
cycle.  Parrot releases the third Tuesday of each month; Rakudo
will generally issue its own development release two days after
the Parrot release.

Each development release is given a sequential number and a 
code name based on an active Perl Mongers group.  Rakudo's
February 2009 release is #14; prior releases were bundled as
part of monthly Parrot releases.

=head2 Suggested .pm group names for future releases

  BristolBath.pm

More names can be gotten from L<http://www.pm.org> if you 
can't think of one with any particular significance to Perl 
6 or Rakudo.

=head2 Steps to create a release (for release managers)

Each Rakudo development release is timed to occur two
days after a Parrot monthly release.

=over 4

=item 1.

A few days before the Parrot release, it's a good idea to...

=over 4

=item *

Remind people of the upcoming release, invite people to
update the ChangeLog file, update the ROADMAP, choose a
release name, etc.

=item *

Verify that the Parrot trunk head is able to build Rakudo
and run the spectest suite. Also check the smolder reports
at L<http://smolder.parrot.org/app/projects/smoke_reports/5>.

=item *

If Parrot's trunk exhibits any problems building or running
Rakudo (that require changes to Parrot to fix), immediately
report them to the Parrot development team so they can be
fixed prior to Parrot's release.

=item *

Review the RT queue for tickets that might need resolving
prior to the release, addressing them as needed.  "Tickets
that need resolving" is left your discretion.  Any problem
that has a large impact on users is worth addressing either
as a fix or as prominent documentation (the README and/or
the release announcement).

=back

=item 2.

Once Parrot issues its monthly release, edit Rakudo's
build/PARROT_REVISION file to contain the C<git describe --tags> output
and release number corresponding to Parrot's monthly
release.  For example, for November 2010 PARROT_REVISION file
contained "RELEASE_2_10_1 2.10.0".  As always, test to make sure Rakudo
still builds and passes its tests.  Once build/PARROT_REVISION
has been set to the Parrot release, it must not be changed until
after the Rakudo release.  In other words, we want each
monthly release of Rakudo to be able to be built using
the immediately prior release of Parrot.

=item 3.

The short period following the Parrot release until the
Rakudo release is generally intended for fixing bugs,
updating documentation, and so on.

=item 4.

As the actual release date nears, review the git log history
to see if any additional items need to be added to the ChangeLog.
This can be conveniently done with  "git log --since=yyyy-mm-dd --reverse".

  $ git commit docs/ChangeLog

=item 5.

When it's time to cut the release, create a new release announcement
in docs/announce/YYYY.MM.  It's often a good idea to use the
previous month's file as a starting point for this.  Highlight areas
in which the new release is significant.  If possible, also give
some small details about the choice of release name.  (If the
details are a bit lengthy, this can often best be done as a separate
section at the bottom of the announcement.)

Include a list of contributors since the last release in the announcement.
You can get an automatically generated list by running

  $ perl tools/contributors.pl

Please check the result manually for duplicates and other errors.

  $ git add docs/announce/YYYY.MM
  $ git commit docs

=item 6.

Update the release dates and names at the top of this file
(F<docs/release_guide.pod>).  Also improve these instructions if
you find any steps that are missing.

  $ git commit docs/release_guide.pod

=item 7.

Make sure everything compiles and runs from a known clean state:

  $ make realclean
  $ perl Configure.pl --gen-parrot
  $ make
  $ make test
  $ make stresstest

Continue adjusting things until make spectest passes as expected.
Often this means fixing a bug, fudging a test, or (temporarily?)
commenting out a test file in t/spectest.data .  Use your best
judgment or ask others if uncertain what to do here.

=item 7.5

Enter the new version into the F<VERSION> file, and commit the changes:

  $ echo 2010.09 > VERSION
  $ git commit -m '[release] bump VERSION' VERSION

=item 8.

Make sure any locally modified files have been pushed back to github.

  $ git status
  $ git push

=item 9.

Create a tarball by entering C<make release VERSION=YYYY.MM>,
where YYYY.MM is the month for which the release is being made.
This will create a tarball file named <rakudo-YYYY.MM.tgz>.

B<Caution>: this steps removes any untracked files in F<t/spec>.
So please make a backup if you have any important data in there.

=item 10.

Unpack the tar file into another area, and test that it
builds and runs properly.  If there are any problems,
fix them and go back to step 7.

=item 11.

Tag the release by its release month ("MMMM.YY") and its code name.

  $ git tag -a -m"tag release #nn" MMMM.YY    # e.g., 2010.02
  $ git tag -a -m"tag release #nn" CODENAME   # e.g., "Bratislava"
  $ git push --tags

=item 12.

Upload the release tarball to github's download area at
L<http://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/downloads>.

=item 13.

To avoid public confusion with Rakudo Star releases that will 
follow a few days after each compiler release, we now publish 
compiler release announcements ONLY to perl6-compiler@perl.org.  
(We may restart widespread announcements of compiler releases 
once they are known, or we may begin publishing a single
announcement for both.)

=item 14.

Update the Wikipedia entry at L<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rakudo>.

=item 15.

Promote the release anywhere else you think appropriate.

=item 16.

You're done!  Celebrate with the appropriate amount of fun.
